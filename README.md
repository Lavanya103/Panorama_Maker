# Panorama_Maker
an OpenCv Project using Python , takes multiple images and gives a Panorama view . The code is crisp and clear .
We will create a panorama generator that will take images as an input and output a stitched image. We will create an automated system that will detect the number of folders and images within the folders and output us the required panoramas.
